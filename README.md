 Its a revolutionary technology that enables users to draw, write, and communicate visually during online meetings by simply pointing their finger at a webcam. Utilizing color recognition and tracking, the system creates a virtual canvas where users can adjust brush size and color.

Built with Python, OpenCV, and computer vision, the project incorporates advanced image processing techniques such as morphological operations, background reduction, and fingertip identification to enhance accuracy and responsiveness. By detecting finger movements in real time through contour detection and image segmentation, the system captures gestures with precision.

This innovative technology has the potential to revolutionize communication, particularly for individuals with hearing impairments. It fosters a more natural interaction between humans and machines, reducing reliance on traditional writing methods. By bridging the gap between digital and traditional creative expressions, this project showcases the promising future of smart wearable technologies and their integration with IoT devices for enhanced functionality and usability.
